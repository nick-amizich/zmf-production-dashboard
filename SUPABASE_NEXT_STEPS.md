# Supabase Integration - Next Steps

## Current Progress ✅

1. **Database Schema** - Complete migration with all tables and RLS policies
2. **Authentication System** - Login page, middleware, and auth hooks ready
3. **Local Development Setup** - Configured for Supabase local development
4. **Type Safety** - TypeScript types generated for all database tables
5. **Seed Data** - Demo users and sample data ready

## To Start Local Development:

1. **Start Supabase:**
```bash
supabase start
```

2. **Apply migrations and seed data:**
```bash
supabase db reset
```

3. **Get your local credentials:**
```bash
supabase status
```

4. **Update `.env.local` with credentials from step 3**

5. **Start the Next.js app:**
```bash
npm run dev
```

6. **Login with demo accounts:**
- Manager: `manager@zmf.com` / `password123`
- Worker: `worker@zmf.com` / `password123`

## Next Implementation Steps:

### 1. Replace Mock Data (Priority: High)
- [ ] Update batch management to use Supabase
- [ ] Convert order management to database queries
- [ ] Replace worker assignments with real data
- [ ] Update production metrics calculations

### 2. Real-time Features (Priority: High)
- [ ] Add real-time batch status updates
- [ ] Implement worker assignment notifications
- [ ] Create live production dashboard updates
- [ ] Add emergency alert broadcasting

### 3. File Upload System (Priority: Medium)
- [ ] Configure Supabase Storage for quality photos
- [ ] Create upload components for QC checks
- [ ] Add image preview and management
- [ ] Implement photo compression

### 4. API Routes (Priority: Medium)
- [ ] Create batch management endpoints
- [ ] Add quality check submission APIs
- [ ] Implement production metrics aggregation
- [ ] Add worker assignment endpoints

### 5. Advanced Features (Priority: Low)
- [ ] Shopify webhook integration
- [ ] Email notifications via Edge Functions
- [ ] Advanced analytics dashboards
- [ ] Offline support with service workers

## Architecture Notes:

- **Authentication**: Uses Supabase Auth with RLS policies
- **Real-time**: Ready for Supabase Realtime subscriptions
- **File Storage**: Quality photos bucket configured
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript coverage

## Security Checklist:

✅ RLS enabled on all tables
✅ Auth middleware protecting routes
✅ Service role key only for server-side
✅ Proper user role validation
✅ Secure session management

The foundation is ready - now you can start replacing the mock data with real Supabase queries!
