- Batch shows warning indicator
- Resolution updates issue status
- Quality metrics update

### Scenario 3: Worker Performance Tracking
1. As admin, go to **/management/workers**
2. View the leaderboard
3. Click on a worker to see details
4. Check their:
   - Completed units
   - Quality score
   - Efficiency rating
   - Specializations

**Expected Results:**
- Performance metrics calculate correctly
- Charts display data
- Availability grid shows schedule

## üîç DATABASE VERIFICATION QUERIES

Run these in Supabase SQL editor to verify data:

```sql
-- Check active workers
SELECT name, email, role, is_active 
FROM workers 
ORDER BY role, name;

-- View recent orders
SELECT o.*, c.name as customer_name, hm.model_name 
FROM orders o
JOIN customers c ON o.customer_id = c.id
JOIN headphone_models hm ON o.model_id = hm.id
ORDER BY o.created_at DESC
LIMIT 10;

-- Check batch pipeline
SELECT b.*, 
  COUNT(DISTINCT o.id) as order_count,
  b.current_stage,
  w.name as assigned_worker
FROM batches b
LEFT JOIN orders o ON o.batch_id = b.id
LEFT JOIN stage_assignments sa ON sa.batch_id = b.id 
  AND sa.stage = b.current_stage
LEFT JOIN workers w ON sa.worker_id = w.id
GROUP BY b.id, w.name
ORDER BY b.created_at DESC;

-- Quality check summary
SELECT 
  qc.stage,
  COUNT(*) as total_checks,
  SUM(CASE WHEN qc.passed THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as passed,
  ROUND(AVG(CASE WHEN qc.passed THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) * 100, 2) as pass_rate
FROM quality_checks qc
GROUP BY qc.stage
ORDER BY qc.stage;

-- Active issues
SELECT qi.*, b.batch_number, w.name as reported_by
FROM quality_issues qi
JOIN batches b ON qi.batch_id = b.id
JOIN workers w ON qi.reported_by = w.id
WHERE qi.resolved_at IS NULL
ORDER BY qi.created_at DESC;
```

## üêõ COMMON ISSUES TO WATCH FOR

1. **Batch Won't Drag:**
   - Check user role (must be manager/admin)
   - Verify batch current_stage
   - Check browser console for errors

2. **Worker Can't See Tasks:**
   - Verify assignment exists in database
   - Check worker specializations match stage
   - Ensure worker is active

3. **Quality Metrics Not Updating:**
   - Verify quality_checks are being created
   - Check date filters
   - Refresh the page

4. **Login Redirects to Login:**
   - Check Supabase auth settings
   - Verify user has worker record
   - Check is_active status

5. **Images Not Uploading:**
   - Check Supabase storage bucket exists
   - Verify storage policies
   - Check file size limits

## üéØ PERFORMANCE TESTING

1. **Create 50+ orders** and batch them
2. **Drag multiple batches** rapidly
3. **Generate large reports** (30+ days)
4. **Open multiple worker sessions**
5. **Upload many photos** for issues

## üîê SECURITY TESTING

1. Try accessing `/admin` as worker
2. Try editing another worker's task
3. Try SQL injection in search fields
4. Check API endpoints require auth
5. Verify RLS policies work

## üì± MOBILE TESTING

1. Open `/worker/mobile` on phone
2. Test touch targets
3. Try camera upload
4. Check responsive layout
5. Test offline capability

Remember: Test as different user roles to ensure permissions work correctly!
